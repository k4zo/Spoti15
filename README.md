# Spoti15
### A Spotify Applet for the Logitech G15/G510S

---
 The original developer has abandoned the project so I've kept this applet updated to work with the latest version of [SpotifyAPI-NET](https://github.com/JohnnyCrazy/SpotifyAPI-NET) and updated it with new features.
 
## Features
1. Three display modes
2. Seeking and playback control (Spotify Premium members only)
3. Follow/Unfollow buttons
4. Text scrolling
5. Sleek display
6. Support for the latest version Spotify 

## Installation
1\. Download the Latest release of Spoti15 from [Here.](https://github.com/eezstreet/Spoti15/releases)

2\. Create a new applet in the Spotify Developer Dashboard. Save the Client ID and Secret ID.

3\. In the Applet page of the Spotify Developer Dashboard, under 'Edit Settings' enter the following URI to the 'Redirect URIs' whitelist: `http://localhost:4002`. Then click 'Add' and finally 'Save'.

4\. Run Spoti15. Use the Client ID and Secret ID in the web browser window that pops up.

5\. (OPTIONAL): Save the Client ID and Secret ID to environment variables (SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID and SPOTIFY_SECRET_ID) to save them across sessions.

6\. Ensure that the application is selected in your Logitech Gaming Software

7\. Ensure that Spotify is Running in the background.

8\. Done!
